BASIC GIT COMMANDS TO HELP ON-BOARD PROJECT

-----------CLONE THE REPOSITORY
- git clone <url>
for examples: git clone https://github.com/zimesfield/order.git
-After cloning the repository execute the script:
- git branch 
you will notice that a main branch has been automatically created by git. This is the default branch as set in github.
And this is the only branch that exists in your local repository.


----------CREATE A BRANCH IN YOUR LOCAL REPOSITORY
Execute the command:
- git checkout -b <branchName>
where branchName is in the format agreed by the team to be "feature/#ticket_number-brief-description.
The above script creates a new branch and switches to that branch on your local repository (repository means on your local system aka server-system storage).

Execute:
- git branch 
to view the list of branches and ensure that the new branch has been added.


------------ADD TO LOCAL REPOSITORY
Work on the module on the branch and then execute:
- git add <path of that file>
e.g. git add src/test/java/com/zimesfield/promotion/usecase/PromotionUseCaseTest.java

------------COMMIT TO LOCAL REPOSITORY
Run the command:
- git commit -m"<description>"

------------PUSH TO REMOTE
Run the command:
- git push origin <branch name of the remote repository to be pushed to>


------------MERGE FROM REMOTE TO LOCAL
Ensure you are switched to your branch, by running:
- git checkout -b <branch name>

then execute:
- git merge origin/<name of remote repository branch>





---------------CREATING A NEW REPOSITORY
First create a new repository in github, then

Run the following in the terminal of your local computer.

- git init 
(creates local git storage).

- git add README.md 
(adds a README file to your local storage).

- git commit -m "first commit" -
(First commit to your local Storage).

- git branch -M <branch name> 
(creates your first branch "main", it can be any other branch name of your choice).

- git remote add <remote name> <url> 
(remotes or connects to github. The "remote name" can be any name of choice, and the url is provided by git hub when you create the repository).
e.g git remote add origin https://github.com/zimesfield/training.git

- git push -u <remote name> <branch name>
(push branch to remote repository)
e.g git push origin main
